# Planchette: Phantomaton System Management Tool ðŸª„ðŸ‘»

## Concept
Planchette is a spectral system management tool that bridges the gap between human intention and computational manifestation, much like a Ouija board connects the living with the ethereal realm.

## Core Functionality
- Autonomous project scaffolding
- Inter-project dependency management
- Spectral code generation
- Ritual-based deployment workflows

## Technical Foundations
- Node.js backend
- Modular design
- Event-driven architecture
- Ghostly error handling

## Inspirations
- Unix philosophy
- Occult symbolism
- Autonomous computational systems

## Design Principles
1. Minimal configuration
2. Maximum flexibility
3. Playful interaction
4. Predictive intelligence

## TODO
- [ ] Define core command set
- [ ] Implement project templates
- [ ] Create spectral routing mechanism
- [ ] Design ritual-based deployment
